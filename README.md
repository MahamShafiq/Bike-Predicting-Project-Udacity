# Bike Sharing Prediction Using Neural Network
 "Deep Learning Fundamentals" I built a neural network to predict bike rental ridership per day in this project.

The Neural Network was worked "without any preparation", utilizing just NumPy to help. The objective of this task is to comprehend what occurs behind the neural system before jumping further into different devices like TensorFlow.

## Results

- 
The task meets the determinations, which are: 

- All the code runs in Python 3 without fizzling, and all unit tests pass in Notebook. 

- The sigmoid initiation work is executed accurately 

- The forward pass is accurately executed for the network preparation. 

- The run strategy effectively creates the ideal relapse yield for the neural system. 

- The system accurately actualizes the retrogressive go for each cluster, effectively refreshing the weight change. 

- Updates to both the contribution input to hidden and hidden to input to-yield loads are actualized accurately. 

- No of epochs that are chosen such the network is trained well enough to accurately make predictions but is not overfitting to the training data.

- The number of hidden unit is picked with the end goal that the system can precisely anticipate the quantity of bicycle riders, can sum up, and isn't overfitting. 

- The learning rate is picked with the end goal that the system effectively unites, yet is still time proficient. 

- No of output nodes is appropriately chosen to take care of the ideal issue. 
The training loss is below 0.07 and the validation loss is below 0.20.
training loss.

## Conclusion
The Model give quite accurate predictions. However, the model overestimes bike ridership in December because it hasn't had sufficient holiday season training examples.
